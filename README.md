# Interactive-Antipode-Map
Is there a link between meteor impacts and volcanic hotspots?  Now I'm curious.

BACKSTORY: One of my favorite YouTubers observed in his video on the biogeography of Hawaii [1] that the hotspot underlying the Hawaiian islands is at approximately the opposite end of the earth from the largest known meteor impact site, the Vredefort Crater in South Africa, and noted a few additional examples of this.

The two current hypotheses on hotspot [2] formation are both associated with the crust (thermal diapir [3] formations or abnormally thin crust), but don't include the mantle as a factor, possibly because so little is known about the circulation of magma aside from convection cells.  It would make sense for large impacts to affect the flow of magma in the mantle and core, but a reasonable hypothesis based on correlation in a small sample does not necessarily equal causation.  So I'm going to create an interactive map showing the antipodes of known astroblemes and mantle plumes to gather more information and determine if there's a statistically significant link.  Sources cited at the bottom.

NOTE: I am not a geologist, just a nerd.  The extent of my education in geology is a lecture series from the Great Courses [4] and I'm limiting the research I do into the topic to the bare minimum because I want to figure it out and diving into the archives of the Journal of Structural Geology might spoil my fun! ðŸ˜ƒ

CORE GOALS:
  1) Click a location, get the coordinates of its antipode.
  2) Have preset values for locations of known hotspots and impact craters.
  3) Highlight matching cases.
  4) Determine if the number of matches constitutes statistical significance.

STRETCH GOALS:
  1) Factor in the size of the impact to see:
      a) if only impacts over a certain size result in hotspot formation, or
      b) if there's a correlation between size of impact and size of hotspot.
  2) Add in a moving graphic, displaying continental motion over time.

POSSIBLE LATER EXPANSIONS:
  1) Other rocky planets, particularly Mars and Venus (which would be an interesting addition due to its lack of tectonic activity)
  2) An examination of cryovolcanism [5] in dwarf planets, Pluto and Ceres, and moons of gas giants, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. I don't expect to find     much there since none are known to have liquid magma in their cores (as far as I know) and any heat they have is likely from gravitational friction       and/or radioactive decay, but it's worth a look!
